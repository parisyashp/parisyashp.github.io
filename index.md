Hello, my name is Parisya Saniya.

I am a final-year Information Systems undergraduate at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) with a strong interest in ERP systems, business analysis, and data-driven consulting.

I enjoy translating complex business problems into structured processes, system requirements, and analytical insights to bridge business needs with technical implementation.

You can see my portofolio [here](/portofolio/) and  my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/parisyashp).

Let's keep in touch! Drop me a message at saniyahendi [at] windowslive [dot] com. See you there :)
