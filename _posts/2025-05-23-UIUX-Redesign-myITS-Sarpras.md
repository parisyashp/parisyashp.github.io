This project focused on the **redesign of an existing internal campus system** at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), specifically within the **Facilities and Infrastructure Division (Sarpras ITS)**. Sarpras is responsible for managing the borrowing and use of campus facilities such as rooms, equipment, and other physical infrastructure.

At the time of this project, the borrowing process was still largely **manual and fragmented**, leading to inefficiencies for both users and administrators. To address this, our team conducted a case study using the **Design Thinking framework** to design a more user-centered, digital solution. The outcome of this project was a conceptual redesign in the form of a mobile and web application prototype called “**myITS Sarpras**.”

**Tools & Skills:** Figma, Design Thinking, UI/UX, User Research

### **Problem**

Based on early-stage user interviews and field observations, we identified several critical issues in the existing process:

- The facility borrowing process was entirely analog and not supported by a centralized digital system.
- Users were required to submit physical documents in person at the Sarpras office to request facility usage.
- The status of borrowing requests was not transparent; users had to manually follow up.
- Confirmation and updates were only available through personal WhatsApp messages with Sarpras staff, creating delays and dependency on individual officers.
- There was no standardized tracking or documentation system for historical borrowing data.
- These issues resulted in inefficiency, poor user experience, and increased administrative workload.

### **Problem**

I acted as a **UI/UX Researcher and Designer**, with responsibilities including:

- Conducting user interviews with students and campus staff
- Identifying user pain points and unmet needs
- Translating research insights into user requirements
- Designing user flows and information architecture
- Creating a high-fidelity UI/UX application prototype



### **Methodology & Deliverables**

This project applied the **Design Thinking framework**, consisting of the following phases:
- **Empathize**:
     Conducted interviews and observations to understand user behavior, frustrations, and expectations.
- **Define**:
     Synthesized research findings into clear problem statements and user personas.
- **Ideate**:
     Generated solution ideas focusing on digitalization, transparency, and process efficiency.
- **Prototype**:
     Designed low-fidelity wireframes and iterated into a high-fidelity UI prototype representing the proposed system.
- **Test**:
     Conducted usability testing to validate flows, usability, and clarity of the interface.



**Key Deliverables**:
- User personas and problem statements
- User flows and task journeys
- High-fidelity UI/UX prototype of myITS Sarpras
- Design rationale aligned with user needs

### **What I Learned**

Through this project, I learned how to:
- Translate manual, real-world administrative processes into digital system designs
- Apply user research findings to guide design decisions
- Design interfaces that balance user convenience and administrative control
- Communicate design decisions clearly in a project-based, consulting-style format
- This project strengthened my understanding of how UI/UX design supports operational efficiency, especially in systems closely related to ERP and institutional workflows.
