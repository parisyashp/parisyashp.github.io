Many university freshmen are highly motivated to join Business Case Competitions (BCC) as a way to develop problem-solving, analytical, and presentation skills. However, most beginner-level learning resources are fragmented, informal, or difficult to access. Newcomers often rely on word-of-mouth, scattered online materials, or trial-and-error learning, which can be overwhelming and inefficient.

Recognizing this gap, our team developed a **beginner-friendly case book** designed as a structured starting point for students who want to learn how business case competitions work—from understanding case structures to developing solutions and presenting them effectively.
