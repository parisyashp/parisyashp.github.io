I am a final-year Information Systems student at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) with academic and practical exposure in enterprise systems, business process engineering, and data analytics.

My experience spans ERP-related coursework, SAP S/4HANA fundamentals, business requirements engineering, and consulting-style problem solving. I have worked on system documentation, BPMN, ERD design, data warehouse development, and strategic dashboards using Power BI.

Through consulting organizations and internships, I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to analyze business problems, validate system requirements, and deliver structured, actionable insights. I am particularly interested in roles such as Business Analyst, ERP Analyst, Data Analyst, and Consulting Analyst.
